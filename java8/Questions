Question 1:
Diff Intermediate and Terminal Operations
1 :The Intermediate Operations produces stream pipelining While 
Terminal operations Terminate the pipelining
2: Intermediate operations can be chained multiple times on a stream
While Terminal operation cannot ne chained
3: Intermediate operation cannot be evaluated independently it needs a Terminal operation for evaluation 
While Terminal operation can be evaluated independently .

Question 2 :
What is the purpouse of functional interface in Java 8
Functional interface are those interface that have a single funcationality
Example :
CompareTo -- This interface is only to compare purpouse
Function---this interface accepts only one argument and gives the result.
This interface means that an object is tested to be either true or false.

Question 3:
What are the new features of Java 8 
New features introduced in Java 8 are:-
Introduction of Lambda Expression- first step to functional programming
New stream API to support pipeline processing.
Optional âˆ’ Emphasis on handling null values properly.
Nashorn Engine- Provides better performance than Rhino javascript engine.


Question 4:
What is Lambda expression 
Lamba expression is considered as the most significant feature of Java8. 
A Lambda expression provides functional programming, and 
that has simplified the code to a great extent. 
A lambda expression is fundamentally a function which can be created
without belonging to any class.
