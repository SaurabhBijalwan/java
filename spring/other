Question What is programming language ,Software Technology and framework ?
Programming Language :Core Java , Raw material ,c++
Software Technology : Semi finished product JDBC , servelet(arragange servlet container) , EJB(arrange ejb container) ,JSP(arragange jsp container)
framework :fully finished product  struts ,spring ,hiberanete 

Programming Language :
Raw material to develop the software application 
Direct installable software 
Defines Syntax (Rules ,;,{}) and Semantics(structure of programming i.e package top , class , constrcutor ) 
Based to create tools ,technology and framework
create Oracle(java) , Linix (c language) window(vc++)

Software Technology : 
Software specification providing set of rules and guidelines to create certain software by using one and another language suppourt.
Uninstallable 
JDBC is software technology provide the set of rule JBDC driver 
Oracle thin driver : odjbc14.jar odbc16.jar represent jbdc driver 

example :JDBC , servelet(arragange servlet container) , EJB(arrange ejb container) ,JSP(arragange jsp container)

Another Angle :
Course Browser: Technology (Topic name ) {Rules and regulation}
Faculty :course browser faculty is software 

Technology based software is importart i.e obdbc14.jar

Interfaces  repreant Rules (must be implemented)
class contains concreate method so whenever we extends in subclass so override is optional
concreate class provide guidelines i.e may be follow 

Question How many type of Technology 
1 Open Technology;
2 Properitetary Technology

Luckly all java technolg developed by Sun microsystem is open Tehchnology 
example obdbc , EJB , servlet 
Open technology increase competion among vendors and which leads better software 


Properitetary Technology 
Rules and guidelines are specific to  on one vendor only 
example : Microsoft tehnology is only allowed to make software 

Question :
How JDBC is allow to open tehnology JDBC Tehnology 
In technology interfaces are rules 
and classes and guidelines
gives Rule and guidelines to delvelop JDBC technlogy : Vendor 1 ......Vendorn

vendor 1 : Sunmicrosystem 
vendor 2 oracle : JDBC driver software for oracle database 
Vendor 3 IBM JDBC driver software for DB2 database software 
All these vendors follow common rules and guidelines 

Example 
Tata , huydai , mauriti car are build on common rules and guidelines in car specification 
if you know learn driving mauriti you can drive any other car

Similary all jdbc technology developed by different vendor 
if you know how to work with one you will know how to work with other 

Question : 
What is Java Framework ?

Raw material 
Programming language: Raw material : Wheats 
Java Technology: Wheats powder
Java Frameworks: Maggie noodle or patanjali noodles 

Defination 1
Frameworks are special installable software that is 
built on the top of one or two or more technology 
having the ability to generate common logic dynamically based on 
Application specific logic given by the Programmer 

Structs uses servlet jsp but it dont programmer to bother about servlet jsp 

Defination 2 
Framework is an special installable software that provide abstration layer on one or more technology 
to simplify the application developement process
example struts spring hibernate jsf etc

Example 
build house 
Option 1 common specific activities : governent permission , dwelling 
Option 2 specific activities : interior , vastu

Option 1 : working with java technology 
Option 2 : working with framework 

so Framework said common logic take cae by framework and we need to care about spefic activities 

Question :
Let see Plain JDC application 
means both common specific logic and specific logic done by us only 
a : Register driver and driver manager Service  |
b : Establish Connection with db software  | Common Logic
c : create Statement Object  |

d : Send and execute Query to DB software | Specific Logic 
e : Gather result and process result  |

f : Exception handling  - common logic 
g : close the connection 

Coomon logic is boiler plate code for several application 

-> abc fg - common logic - Boiler plate code
-> de - specific logic - changed application to application 

Question 
what do you mean Boiler palte code problem 
Code repeat application to application 

Spring JDBC Application 
Inject JDBC template connection 
send and sql query to database 
Gather result and process result


Notice that here we are spring jbdc connection is handling a,b,c,f, g take care of everything

Question 
Why framework are popular 
Provides 
Productivity is good -> less time we can develop more application 
framework are designed after realtime usecases 
example In online shopping website double posting problem is there 
cliked in refresh button 
double amount is deducted dublicate form is submitted 
Bad practice - > In servlet need to write 100 of lines  
override the method in spring resolved that problem 

1 concentrate on specic logic only
