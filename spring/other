Question What is programming language ,Software Technology and framework ?
Programming Language :Core Java
Software Technology :
framework :struts ,spring ,hiberanete 

Programming Language :
Raw material to develop the software application 
Direct installable software 
Defines Syntax (Rules ,;,{}) and Semantics(structure of programming i.e package top , class , constrcutor ) 
Based to create tools ,technology and framework
create Oracle(java) , Linix (c language) window(vc++)

Software Technology : 
Software specification providing set of rules and guidelines to create certain software by using one and another language suppourt.
Uninstallable 
JDBC is software technology provide the set of rule JBDC driver 
Oracle thin driver : odjbc14.jar odbc16.jar represent jbdc driver 

example :JDBC , servelet(arragange servlet container) , EJB(arrange ejb container) ,JSP(arragange jsp container)

Another Angle :
Course Browser: Technology (Topic name ) {Rules and regulation}
Faculty :course browser faculty is software 

Technology based software is importart i.e obdbc14.jar

Interfaces  repreant Rules (must be implemented)
class contains concreate method so whenever we extends in subclass so override is optional
concreate class provide guidelines i.e may be follow 

Question How many type of Technology 
1 Open Technology;
2 Properitetary Technology

Luckly all java technolg developed by Sun microsystem is open Tehchnology 
example obdbc , EJB , servlet 
Open technology increase competion among vendors and which leads better software 


Properitetary Technology 
Rules and guidelines are specific to  on one vendor only 
example : Microsoft tehnology is only allowed to make software 

Question :
How JDBC is allow to open tehnology JDBC Tehnology 
In technology interfaces are rules 
and classes and guidelines
gives Rule and guidelines to delvelop JDBC technlogy : Vendor 1 ......Vendorn

vendor 1 : Sunmicrosystem 
vendor 2 oracle : JDBC driver software for oracle database 
Vendor 3 IBM JDBC driver software for DB2 database software 
All these vendors follow common rules and guidelines
